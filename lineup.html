            <p>Student during mornings, developer at afternoons and open source
contributor by evenings. Michal is programming languages enthusiast,
focusing mostly on the functional side. He is a member of the Elixir's Ecto
core team and maintainer of the MongoDB adapter. He's Google Summer of Code
2015 alumni, where he worked on Ecto and its MongoDB integration supervised
by José Valim himself. When not programming he enjoys reading books,
travelling, and sailing - no matter if sunny, rainy or stormy - it's even
better if all of those are combined!

            <p>Bozhidar is the author of RuboCop and the editor of the community Ruby
style guide. He's involved in a myriad of open-source projects, mostly
related to Ruby, Clojure and Emacs. Many people would probably describe him
as an Emacs zealot (and they would be right). He's also quite fond of the
Lisp family of languages, functional programming in general and Clojure in
particular.

            <h4>Immutable Data Structures for Functional JS</h4>

            <p>Functional programming has been gaining a lot of popularity in the JS
community, and with good reason: rejecting side-effects and mutability -
in-place changes to data - helps avoid a lot of headaches. But when you
refuse to mutate objects, you have to create a whole new object each time
something changes, which can slow things down and eat up memory, making
functional programming seem inefficient.

That’s where immutable data structures come in - to save the day, and time
and space! Also called “persistent data structures”, they help you
efficiently make new “modified” versions of immutable objects, by reusing
parts of the old object that you don’t need to change.

In this talk we’ll take a look at how these data structures work, why
they’re fantastic for functional programming, and how we can easily use
them in our JS code thanks to libraries like Mori and Immutable.js.

Native to launch iOS/Android apps to its one million website users. I will

programming was at age 12, scripting a Half life mod that placed a number
of angry fish out of water while assassins ran around the perimeter. She
has worked as an artist, curator, spatial designer, and writer -- not
necessarily in that order -- before moving on to programming
professionally. She currently spends her time debugging the debugger while
developing developer tools. She feels strongly about elegantly programmed
UIs, testing, and simplicity.
