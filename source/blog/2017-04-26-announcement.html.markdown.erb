Hi there. We are Genadi, Vestimir, Svetlio & Svetlio. It‚Äôs nice to meet you! ü§ù

You might have seen us running around like crazy on the last EuRuKo. The event
was well received and we decided to follow it with something a bit different.
Something functional. Something for the web‚Ä¶ Let us humbly try to entice you!

Imagine spending a long early-autumn weekend in sunny Sofia, enjoying delicious
Balkan food and drinks. Visiting some centuries-old monuments, all while
getting ready for a couple of conference days full of interesting lectures
covering a wide range of functional programming topics and engaging workshops
focusing on the practical side of things. With great socializing/networking
opportunities at both our pre-event and at the after party. Sounds tempting,
doesn‚Äôt it?

This temptation is called [Partial][website]! [Partial][website] is a brand new
conference focusing on modern functional programming languages and technologies
for the web. Think [Erlang], [Elixir], [Clojure], [ClojureScript], [Haskell], [Elm],
PureScript, [F#], [React], [Redux] and many more. It‚Äôs a conference that can get you
outside your comfort zone and let you learn something new.

Checking out our website, you can already see a few speakers covering Elixir,
Clojure and Elm. Want to learn about something else? This is where you come in!
We would like to invite you to participate in our Call for Speakers! If you
have a favorite topic you would like to talk about, or hands-on experience you
would like to share with the world, please kindly drop everything you are doing
right now and apply at our website. The deadline is 28th of May. Write this
down!

Be sure to subscribe to our newsletter and follow us on [twitter]. And expect
our future posts about the format of the conference, Sofia, the universe and
everything else!

Yours partially! ‚ù§Ô∏è
