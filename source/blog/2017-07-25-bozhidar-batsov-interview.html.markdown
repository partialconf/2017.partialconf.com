Following last week's interview with [Saša Jurić][Sasa], we are bringing you
another one, this time by no other than [Bozhidar Batsov][Bozhidar]. [Bozhidar]
will be talking to us about: Clojure: The Bad Parts.

## Tell us a bit about yourself? (Simple introduction)

I'm the maintainer of [CIDER] and the editor of the community [Clojure] style
guide. Most people would probably describe me as an Emacs zealot (and they
would be right). I'm also quite fond of Unix-like operating systems, the Lisp
family of languages, functional programming in general and [Clojure] in
particular.

I've been programming professionally for 12 years and throughout my career I've
been using over a dozen programming languages. Currently I work at [Toptal],
shaping up the future of work. 

Believe it or not, I have hobbies and interests outside the realm of computers,
but I won't bore with those here.

## How did you get into programming?

When I was little I wanted to play computer games and the only way I could
convince my parents to buy me a computer (which they considered an expensive
toy) was to lie to them I needed it to be become a programmer. I enrolled in a
CS major in high-school to make them believe me, got my first computer and the
rest is history. I didn't really enjoy programming at first, but over time it
grew on me. Especially after I starting hacking with languages like Ruby and
Common Lisp. 

## How did you get into functional programming?

A former boss of my was preaching all the time about the might and magic of
Common Lisp. He got me interested in Lisp and eventually I got interested in
functional programming. Scala, Haskell and [Clojure] played a big part in making
me an FP believer. Together with an ever growing frustration with big
complected systems built using OO languages. 

## Why that tech?

It's a Lisp with which you can actually build something useful and practical.
And it's modern! And it's under active development! And it's pushing the
boundaries every day!

## Why that talk?

Because no one is perfect and there's always an opportunity for improvement.
And because it's a topic avoided by most Clojure developers.
