With this out of the way, the workshop themselves:

## Creating a Programming Language From Scratch
### [Kjetil Valle][kjetil] & [Joel Chelliah][joel]

Have you ever wanted to implement a programming language from scratch? Doing so
can be a rewarding and educational experience, and it's probably much easier
than you think. We will guide you through the hoops of creating a small, but
neat, programming language.

By the end of the workshop you will be the proud author of a programming
language, and will hopefully have a better understanding of how programming
languages work. The goal is for you to make a relatively simple language, with
the following features:

- A handful of data types (integers, booleans, symbols, and strings)
- Variables (with lexical scoping)
- First class functions 
- That nice, homemade quality feeling

The workshop will guide you through the process of creating your language using
a hands-on TDD approach. We provide the tests, and all you need to do is to get
them to pass, one by one.

We will be following the materials from https://github.com/kvalle/diy-lisp. You
will be coding in Python, and the language you create will have a syntax
similar to Lisp (mainly to keep the parser as simple as possible). You will
have all the explanation you need, and we'll be there to help you every step of
the way.

No experience with creating languages is required. Familiarity with Python is
helpful, but is not required either, as the code you'll need to write is
surprisingly straightforward. 

## Scala is Love
### [Kamen Kotsev][kamen]

This workshop will be targeted at people who hadn't yet tried Scala or who just
started writing in Scala. Functional background is not necessary as we will not
go that deep into functional Scala, rather than just demonstrate the basics.
The talk will be best fitted for Haskell or Java developers. We will cover
language basics, differences with other languages and how to start developing
in Scala efficiently.

We will talk a little bit about Scala basics, for anyone that hadn't yet tried
coding in Scala. Then we'll do some examples of the OOP and functional parts in
Scala implementing some basic structures. We will first create some ordinary
classes in order to get a handle on the syntax and demonstrate how to write
tests in Scala. If the group is going fast we will then implement the List
and/or the Option monads. After that we will make an implementation of a syntax
interpolator for reading expressions from string and evaluating them. That way
we will demonstrate an advanced language features, and the pattern matching
mechanisms in the language.

Last, but not least... we have an offer for you, our deer early adopters. Am I
an early adopter, you may ask? Well, if you already have a ticket, you are!

For all of you, that have purchased tickets, before we announced the workshops,
we are offering you a free workshop of your choice! üò≠ Send us a mail at

Have a great summer, all! ‚ù§Ô∏è
