Shh! üò∂ Let me stop you right there. You have a question? We have the answers!
All two of them.

## What‚Äôs the format?

Partial is a two-day, single-track conference with long sessions and workshops.
The first day, Friday, 22nd of September, will host 7 talks. The Saturday will
host 3 training sessions, running simultaneously in the morning and will end
with 3 more talks in the afternoon.

A training session will run for around 5 hours and a talk will last for 40
minutes. As a speaker or a trainer, this means you will have enough time to dig
deep into your topic. As an attendee, you‚Äôll still get 2 days of a conference
(even if you don‚Äôt attend a training session), and some free time to hang
around in Sofia, Bulgaria!

## What do I get if I‚Äôm selected?

As a speaker or a trainer, we will be cover all of your travelling
accommodations. This means that the flight and the hotel stay is on us. It‚Äôs a
great way to get to the conference without making it a big investment.

You get spread the functional love! We do feel the need of talking about some
tech you don‚Äôt see that often in the mainstream conferences. You can help
spread the word about that little project you like so much.

Last, but not least, speaking at a conference is a great personal development.
It makes you more marketable in-front of your current and future employers, it
helps you explain your ideas better, you get to make new friends‚Ä¶ All that good
stuff!
