With the conference just around the corner, we have Anna from Pizzahut talking
to us about her journey into functional programming.

## Tell us a bit about yourself?

I'm a programmer who studies psychotherapy. I love logic, spotting patterns,
analysis, solving problems; as well as drawing, writing poetry, playing a harp.
I enjoy discovering new things in tech, travelling, and having long discussions
over a good drink with fellow coders.

## How did you get into programming?

When I was 13, I had a blog on livejournal and spent a lot of time enhancing
its layouts. I learnt css and html to keep up with the amazing, flashy designs
of my friends' blogs. Later on, I added javascript to my website to make things
move and pop-up. A few years later, I found myself studying Cybernetics and
Robotics because I fell in love with Isaac Asimov's books.

## How did you get into functional programming?

I had the luck of working with some very bright, talented devs at Red Badger
who introduced me to FP.

## Why that tech?

It's logical, easy to test and reason about, scales well. Also, it's kind of
beautiful.

## Why that talk?

FP has so much value in programming, and it seems a shame front-end developers
seem hesitant to adopt it. I know it's hard to pick up the principles - I
struggled, too - but it's so worth it. I like speaking on this topic to bring
FP to as many front-enders as possible. Convert the masses ;)
