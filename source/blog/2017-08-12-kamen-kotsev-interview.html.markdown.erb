Wondering whether to get a ticket for the [Scala] is Love workshop? Maybe this
interview with [Kamen Kotsev][Kamen] will be your turning point.

## Tell us a bit about yourself

I'm a programmer at [HackSoft] and a student at the [Faculty of Mathematics and
Informatics in Sofia][Uni]. I like teaching and I teach Java programming courses at
[HackBulgaria]. I've also assisted in some C++ courses at the Faculty that I
study in. At the moment I'm the lead [Scala] programmer for Hopper's team in
Bulgaria.

## How did you get into programming?

I started programming when I was 14 or 15 years old in high school. The
language we studied was C++ and it was amazing for me that I could make the
computer do things on my command, whether it was to solve a maths problem, or
display graphics on the screen.

Afterwards, I started making simple websites, initially using PHP and front-end
languages without relying on frameworks, and later on taking advantage of
databases and some PHP and JS frameworks. I realise now that being able to
write basic frameworks myself helped me understand how they work when I started
using them.

## How did you get into functional programming?

I took a course in university that was in Scheme and Haskell and I was amazed
of the power of functional programming. The way we presented data structures
and algorithms was so different than what we did in C++ or Java, and it was so
much easier to solve both simple and complex problems. I clearly remember
saying that I would be very happy if I can work using functional languages one
day.

## Why that tech?

Why [Scala]? Well, it's a good symbiosis between object oriented architecture,
functional programming and mutability when you really need it. Every language
has its strengths and weaknesses, and [Scala] is no different, but for me at the
moment, the strengths overwhelm the weaknesses. Also I wanted to talk about
something that's relatively new. [Scala] has been around for some time but it
really started to shine in 2013 when a whole lot of stuff got added into it, so
It's relatively new in Bulgaria.

## Why that talk?

The talk is mainly for people that haven't had the chance to work with [Scala]
that much. I hope to show them that having the power of functional programming
mixed with the freedom of mutability and object oriented design is
something worth knowing. I'll show some interesting ways we can use [Scala] and
why I like it so much.
