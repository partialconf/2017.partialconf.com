        <p>This week we have <strong>Creating Programming Language from Scratch</strong> trainer
<a href="https://github.com/kvalle">Kjetil Valle</a> on the line. Thank you <a href="https://github.com/kvalle">Kjetil</a> for taking the time to
talk with us. If you wanna visit his training, make sure to <a href="/tickets">get your ticket</a> as
the seating is limited.</p>

<h2>Tell us a bit about yourself?</h2>

<p>Hi! My name is Kjetil, and I&rsquo;m from Oslo, Norway, where work for a local
consultancy. I&rsquo;ve been working with different customers in the public sector
for the last six years. I&rsquo;m passionate about helping the local programming
community, and have been organizing conferences and meetups in Oslo for a
number of years, mostly with a focus on functional programming. When I&rsquo;m not
programming or organizing, you&rsquo;ll probably find me out somewhere tasting a new
beer, or playing board games with friends. Or both!</p>

<h2>How did you get into programming?</h2>

<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t start programming until I got to university. I had been
copy-pasting and making changes to some JavaScript now and then before, but
didn&rsquo;t have a good understanding of what I was doing. In university I mainly
used Java, C and Python, of which I strongly preferred the latter. This was, as
I found later, because I there could write code in a somewhat more functional
way.</p>

<h2>How did you get into functional programming?</h2>

<p>My first brush with functional programming must have been with the language Oz,
which we learned in a course on programming with different paradigms. After
this I started playing around with various new languages, and tried out Prolog,
Lisp (Scheme, mostly), Haskell, and some others. </p>

<p>These days I&rsquo;m mostly into Elm; It not only let me write frontend code in a
clean and functional way, but I also get to use it in projects at work. I
actually like Elm so much I helped organize the first ever Elm conference in
Norway (and only the third in the world!) back in June. </p>

<h2>Why that tech?</h2>

<p>I think my first inspiration for implementing a simple programming language was
reading the article <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html">The Roots of Lisp</a>
by Paul Graham. I read his description of how Lisp works, and almost couldn&rsquo;t
believe that was all there was to it. So I read <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.111.8833&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">John McCarthy&rsquo;s original paper</a>
and found it really was, and figured I&rsquo;d give it a shot, which resulted in an
<a href="http://kjetilvalle.com/posts/original-lisp.html">implementation in Python</a>.</p>

<p>After finishing the core of the language I had a lot of fun adding different
new features. For instance, the original Lisp has dynamically scoped functions,
so I changed that to lexical scoping, which virtually all languages use
nowadays.</p>

<h2>Why that talk?</h2>

<p>After playing a round with my toy language for a while I had written a number
of tests. (I implemented it in Python, after all…) I figured that if I removed
the actual implementation, people might be able to re-implement it by simply
using the tests as a guide (and not having to read the papers and other
literature).</p>

<p>That didn&rsquo;t turn out to quite be the case: I had to add a lot more tests. But
after doing that—and writing some descriptions of what we were doing along the
way—<a href="https://github.com/kvalle/diy-lang">the workshop</a> was born!</p>

<p>I really like giving this workshop. I had some proper &ldquo;ah!&rdquo;-moments making it,
and I enjoy seeing other people going through the same. One such is the
realization that function closures are just simple data structures. Another is
the feeling of writing code in the language you&rsquo;ve implemented yourself just
minutes ago.</p>

<p>Another reason I like doing this workshop is that it&rsquo;s completely test driven,
which means that people are working at their individually preferred pace. Some
people might race through, while other might only get past the first few
exercises, but both groups tend to have fun and learn a lot along the way :)</p>
