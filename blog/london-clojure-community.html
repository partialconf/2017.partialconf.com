      <div class="content">
        <p>This week we have John Stevenson from the London <a href="http://www.londonclojurians.org">Clojurians</a> talking to us
about the state of <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> in London, from his point of view.</p>

<h2>The London tech scene</h2>

<p>London is a great city for technical communities as there is a large
concentration of developers working here from all over Europe. There are many
hundreds of communities to get involved with and you can easily find many
engaging meetups to attend every night and lots of hack days and hackathons at
weekends too.</p>

<p>There are many companies who support these developer communities, especially
<a href="https://skillsmatter.com">SkillsMatter</a> who provide a venue for any technical communities to use for
free. There is also a lot of activity in the many universities around London,
with students looking to extend their experiences beyond what the learn on
their courses. And of course, there is a very active startup scene in London,
much of which is in the &ldquo;Silicon Roundabout&rdquo; area of London.</p>

<p>More people are discovering the benefits of a career in software development
thanks to several communities aimed at helping people get into coding. Codebar
has weekly events where experienced developers coach those new to coding in a
range of languages. Our own community runs <a href="https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io">ClojureBridge London</a> events where
we have helped 150+ people to code through <a href="and%20ClojureScript">Clojure</a></p>

<p>London is a great place for a career using <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> with many companies
advertising <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> specific roles and start-ups adopting <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> too. There
are also many opportunities in Functional Programming with other languages too,
especially in Scala and a growing interest in Haskell. There is even a
Functional Programming focused recruitment company called <a href="https://functional.works-hub.com">Functional Works</a>.</p>

<h2>Why are you excited about Clojure</h2>

<p>There is a simple joy of developing in <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> and I find it very addictive.
I fire up a <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> REPL, typically in <a href="http://spacemacs.org">Spacemacs</a>, and I really feel
connected to every line of code I am writing. I love the instant feedback the
REPL gives me on both the code and tests I write, providing a great deal of
insight into what the code is actually doing at any given time.</p>

<p>Datomic is the <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> database that lets you store the entire history of your
data, rather than just the current state and I will be working on high value
project using this technology. Its a very exciting new challenge and its great
to see how the business I am working for really values <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> as a technology
that gives it a competitive advantage.</p>

<h2>Personal highlights from the last year</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen our community grow continually over the last 10 years and I am
excited to see more people enjoying the fun of <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a>. Helping developers to
think functionally has been very rewarding, so it&rsquo;s great to see
more and more developers learning <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a>. There is a huge amount of support
available from online communities, a wide range of books and so many great
tutorials. It has become really easy to learn to do just about anything in
<a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> and there is no sign of this abating.</p>

<p>The last few years have seen a big rise for ClojureScript, developing
applications for node and client side single page apps. ClojureScript is now
self-hosted and has great tooling support from <a href="http://planck-repl.org">Plank</a> and <a href="https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo">Lumo</a>. I am also
excited to see ClojureScript on mobile becoming a viable option through <a href="http://cljsrn.org/">React
Native</a>.</p>

<p>We have been mentoring more people in <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> and Functional Programming for
many years and helping them get their first job with <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a>. Much of the
mentoring is done via our coding dojo events, where we decide on a challenge
and get into groups of 2-4 people to create our solutions. At the end of the
event, we share what we have created so we can all learn a little bit more.
I&rsquo;ve also started running weekly mentoring sessions with several developers,
adding structure and focus to their learning, providing clarity where concepts
are not well understood. This has been very rewarding and has given myself a
much better insight into areas of <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> I know well and identifying those I
find a little opaque.</p>

<h2>What are your future plans for the meetup</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.londonclojurians.org">The London Clojurians</a> meetup is one of the most active
communities in London in terms of events, with 4 meetups each month (2 coding
dojo&rsquo;s, a talk-night and a one-day workshop). We also organise an annual
<a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8783-clojure-exchange-2017">ClojureX</a> conference in December and this year is our 10th anniversary.</p>

<p>We have been encouraging new speakers to present their experiences at the talk
nights and we want to see this increase. Hearing these experiences gives
insight into understanding how better to help those seeking to gain more
confidence with <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> and how we can improve <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> itself. We hope to see
an even greater number of people sharing their experiences at these events in
future.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s challenging to run more than 4 events a month, so, we would like to
experiment with virtual events to reach a wider audience and access a wider
range of speakers. Having speakers present virtually to a live audience will
provide the interaction missing from simply watching a video. Running workshops
virtually will enable anyone (in a reasonable time zone) to join in and again
have some level of interaction. Having run a one-day <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> workshop for the
last few years as part of <a href="http://hackthetower.co.uk">HackTheTower</a>. I will run this virtually covering a
specific topic or project each month. If this virtual workshop is successful,
then I hope to run it more often.</p>

on the <code>#clojure-uk</code> channel of the clojurians slack community.</p>
