          <a class="fancy" href="https://www.tick42.com/">Tick42</a> is an
          international company with office in Sofia, London and New York, that
          delivers software to some of the world’s largest investment banks and
          hedge funds. We’re always looking for critically thinking people to
          <a class="fancy" href="https://www.tick42.com/careers">join</a> our
          Sofia team.  With a history of helping large corporate clients
          rethink the way that they structure internal development, we are
          particularly interested in how desktop and web applications can
          interwork to provide an enriched user experience. Our integration
          product, <a class="fancy" href="https://glue42.com/">Glue</a>,
          achieves that and as a consequence can help break down the barriers
          between development teams. This in turn enables developers to break
          free from the silos that restrict their imagination allowing for a
          more integrated and user-focused approach to UX and architecture.
