  talk: Actor Model in Elixir
  bio: |
    Student during mornings, developer at afternoons and open source
    contributor by evenings. Michal is programming languages enthusiast,
    focusing mostly on the functional side. He is a member of the Elixir's Ecto
    core team and maintainer of the MongoDB adapter. He's Google Summer of Code
    2015 alumni, where he worked on Ecto and its MongoDB integration supervised
    by José Valim himself. When not programming he enjoys reading books,
    travelling, and sailing - no matter if sunny, rainy or stormy - it's even
    better if all of those are combined!

  bio: |
    Bozhidar is the author of RuboCop and the editor of the community Ruby
    style guide. He's involved in a myriad of open-source projects, mostly
    related to Ruby, Clojure and Emacs. Many people would probably describe him
    as an Emacs zealot (and they would be right). He's also quite fond of the
    Lisp family of languages, functional programming in general and Clojure in
    particular.

  talk: Immutable Data Structures for Functional JS
  bio: |
    Functional programming has been gaining a lot of popularity in the JS
    community, and with good reason: rejecting side-effects and mutability -
    in-place changes to data - helps avoid a lot of headaches. But when you
    refuse to mutate objects, you have to create a whole new object each time
    something changes, which can slow things down and eat up memory, making
    functional programming seem inefficient.

    That’s where immutable data structures come in - to save the day, and time
    and space! Also called “persistent data structures”, they help you
    efficiently make new “modified” versions of immutable objects, by reusing
    parts of the old object that you don’t need to change.

    In this talk we’ll take a look at how these data structures work, why
    they’re fantastic for functional programming, and how we can easily use
    them in our JS code thanks to libraries like Mori and Immutable.js.

  talk: Using Clojurescript to Launch iOS/Android Apps to 1M Users
  bio: |
    Story of how a small company in Azerbaijan used ClojureScript + React
    Native to launch iOS/Android apps to its one million website users. I will
    go through how we were able to quickly develop and iterate both iOS and
    Android versions at the same time, how we connected existing Rails app to
    provide a Transit API, and how we use CodePush to provide over-the-air
    updates without going through app stores.

  talk: |
    Functional programming can greatly improve readability and scalability of
    your code - yet on front-end, we seem stuck with vaguely (un)defined
    principles. One of the most used libraries on the front-end React doesn’t
    seem to be very functional-friendly with all its classes. However, it does
    follow some functional patterns, and we as developers can choose to use
    these to the maximum. In this talk, you’ll learn what these patterns are,
    how redux fits into the picture with immutability and pure functions, and
    how you can make your async flow easy to reason about with functional
    libraries.
